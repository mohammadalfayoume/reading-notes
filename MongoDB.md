>Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
1) SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.
2) SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
3) SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
4) SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
5) SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.



>What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

Organise and unique data

>Give a real world example.

Replication: By replicating MySQL database across multiple nodes the work load can be reduced heavily increasing the scalability and availability of business application

>What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

to store big data.

>Give a real world example.

Speed: For simple queries, it gives good performance, as all the related data are in single document which eliminates the join operations.

>Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

 NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

>Which type of database is best for scalability?

Apache Cassandra

_______

>What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

>What is a relational database?

 A type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

>What type of structure does a relational database work with?

A relational database organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table. Data is typically structured across multiple tables.

>What is a 'schema'?

 A database schema is considered the “blueprint” of a database which describes how the data may relate to other tables or other data models.

>What is a NoSQL database?

Not only structured query language

>How does it work?

NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables.

>What is inside of a Mongo database?

MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

>Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.

>What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

Compatibility issues with SQL instructions.
