## Software Design Patterns Simplified

A design pattern is only a description or template for how to solve a problem! that can be used in many different situations. A design pattern is only a description or template for how to solve a problem! that can be used in many different situations.

In the case of object-oriented programming paradigm, design patterns are generally aimed at solving the problems of object generation and communication, rather than the larger scale problems of overall software architecture. 

* Programming Paradigms: A way to classify programming languages based on their coding styles and features. Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language (Procedural, Functional, Object-oriented…).

* Architectural Patterns: Reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context. They are similar to software design pattern but have a broader scope (MVC, Micro-services, Layered...).

* Design Patterns: Reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design within a given context. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations (Bridge, Builder, Strategy…).

* Design Principles: Represent a set of guidelines that help developers to avoid having a bad design. Writing code according to proven principles helps achieving code maintainability and simplicity(KISS, Liskov Substitution, Inversion of Control…).

### Creational Patterns:

1- Factory Method

2- Singleton

3- Abstract Factory

### Structural Patterns:
Structural patterns provide a manner to define relationships between classes or objects. Making it easier for these entities to work together.

1- Facade

2- Adapter

3- Decorator

### Behavioral Patterns:

Behavioral patterns define manners of communication between classes and objects. Making it easier and more flexible for these entities to communicate.

1- Observer

2- Mediator

3- Chain of Responsibility

## Risk Analysis

Risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

Now, you must know there are certain risks that are unavoidable:

1- The time that you allocated for testing

2- A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application

3- Urgency from the clients to deliver the project

4- Incomplete requirements
